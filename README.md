# Hi, I'm Karim! 👋


## 🚀 About Me<br>
Hey there! I'm a Front-end Web Developer based in the beautiful city of Paris, France :fr:.<br> Two years ago, I made a life-changing decision to switch careers and dive into the world of web development.<br> I'm passionate about Front End and Mobile Development, and I've never looked back since!

:computer: My Tech Stack<br>
Front End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React, Next, Tailwindcss<br>
Back End: Node.js, Express, PHP, Laravel<br>
Mobile Development: React Native, Swift, SwiftUI<br>
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase<br>
Version Control: Git, GitHub<br>
:sparkles: What I Love<br>
Creating visually appealing and user-friendly web and mobile applications is what drives me every day. I believe that a great user experience goes hand in hand with clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

:earth_americas: A Little More About Me<br>
When I'm not busy coding, you can find me exploring the streets of Paris or at the Parc des Princes, indulging in French cuisine, or reading all of the post-apocalyptic books ever written. 🧟

⚡️ Fun fact : <br>
The difference between a million and a billion :<br>
If you think about it in seconds it’s way more clear ! 2 millions seconds is equal to 2 weeks, when 2 billions seconds is equal to 63 years…
So fellow billionaires share ffs<br>
