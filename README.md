# Hi, I'm Karim! 👋

## 🚀 About Me<br>
Hey there! I'm a Quality Assurance Tech Analyst and Front-end Web Developer based in the beautiful city of Paris, France :fr:.<br> Two years ago, I made a life-changing decision to switch careers and dive into the world of web development and quality assurance.<br> I'm passionate about Front End Development, Mobile Development, and QA, and I’ve never looked back since!

:computer: My Tech Stack<br> Front End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React, Next, Tailwindcss<br> Back End: Node.js, Express, PHP, Laravel<br> Mobile Development: React Native, Swift, SwiftUI, Kotlin<br> QA & Testing: Playwright, Selenium<br> Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase<br> Version Control: Git, GitHub<br> :sparkles: What I Love<br> Ensuring that web and mobile applications are both visually appealing and functionally sound is what drives me every day. I believe a great user experience must come with a high level of reliability and clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

:earth_americas: A Little More About Me<br> When I'm not busy testing or coding, you can find me exploring the streets of Paris or at the Parc des Princes, indulging in French cuisine, or reading all of the post-apocalyptic books ever written. 🧟

⚡️ Fun fact : <br>
The difference between a million and a billion :<br>
If you think about it in seconds it’s way more clear ! 2 millions seconds is equal to 2 weeks, when 2 billions seconds is equal to 63 years…
So fellow billionaires share ffs<br>
